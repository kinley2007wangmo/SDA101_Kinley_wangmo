# Practical 6 – Web Design and TailwindCSS

## Overview
This practical focuses on learning and applying **front-end web design concepts** using both traditional **HTML & CSS** and the **TailwindCSS framework**.  
The main goal was to create visually appealing, responsive, and interactive web pages — one using **pure CSS styling** and the other using **TailwindCSS utility classes**.

## Exercise 1 – Portfolio Webpage (HTML & CSS)
In this exercise, I created a **personal portfolio webpage** that includes:
- A navigation bar with logo, menu links, and social media buttons (GitHub & LinkedIn)
- A hero section with a gradient background introducing the developer
- "About Me", "Skills", and "My Work" sections
- A clean, professional layout with cards for skills and projects

This exercise helped me understand the structure of modern portfolios, layout organization using **Flexbox and Grid**, and how to apply colors, hover effects, and spacing through **CSS**.

## Exercise 2 – Kinley’s Fashion Studio (TailwindCSS)
In this exercise, I recreated a **fashion studio website** using **TailwindCSS**.  
The page includes:
- A responsive gradient navigation bar  
- A welcome section with a button featuring hover micro-interactions  
- A **job listings table** for fashion-related roles  
- A **design gallery** showcasing multiple images in a responsive grid  
- A footer section using gradient colors

This exercise demonstrated the simplicity and speed of styling with **TailwindCSS classes**, especially when building modern, clean interfaces without writing long custom CSS code.
