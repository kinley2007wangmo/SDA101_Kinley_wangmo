# Reflection – Practical 6 (Web Design & TailwindCSS)

## Learning Objectives
The objective of this practical was to design and style web pages using both **standard CSS** and **TailwindCSS**.  
I learned how to create structured layouts, apply design consistency, and explore responsive design using both approaches.

## Exercise 1 – Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS)
### What I Learned
- Learned how to build a **complete personal portfolio** using HTML and CSS.  
- Practiced using **Flexbox and Grid** for layout alignment.  
- Improved understanding of **color schemes**, **card designs**, and **hover effects**.

### Challenges Faced
- Initially faced difficulties aligning navbar items and ensuring spacing consistency.  
- Adjusting font sizes and section padding for a balanced layout required several refinements.

### How I Overcame Them
- Used `display: flex` and `justify-content` strategically to center items.  
- Previewed frequently in the browser to check responsive spacing and appearance.

## Exercise 2 – TailwindCSS (Kinley’s Fashion Studio)
### What I Learned
- Discovered how **TailwindCSS** can simplify web design by eliminating the need for a separate CSS file.  
- Learned how to apply **utility-first classes** for instant styling and responsiveness.  
- Implemented hover animations, responsive grids, and gradient backgrounds.

### Challenges Faced
- Remembering multiple Tailwind class names was initially confusing.  
- Adjusting responsiveness across different screen sizes took some trial and error.

### How I Overcame Them
- Referred to the **TailwindCSS documentation** and practiced class combinations.  
- Used browser developer tools to test different breakpoints for responsive design.

## Overall Reflection
This practical helped me gain strong confidence in both **traditional CSS** and **modern TailwindCSS** approaches.  
I realized that while CSS provides more control, TailwindCSS speeds up the design process significantly.  
Both exercises strengthened my visual design skills and taught me the importance of balance, readability, and layout consistency in web design.

### Future Improvements
- I plan to enhance the portfolio with **animations and transitions**.  
- I aim to use **Tailwind components** for building more complex layouts quickly.  
- I will also experiment with **mobile-first design** techniques for better responsiveness.
