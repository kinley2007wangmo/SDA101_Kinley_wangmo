#  Reflection – Quality Care Website

##  Project Context
This project was created as part of my web design and development practice using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS**.  
The goal was to design a healthcare-themed website that looks clean, professional, and responsive while maintaining visual balance and accessibility.

---

##  What I Learned
- I learned how to structure a full webpage into multiple sections using semantic HTML.
- I gained hands-on experience in **TailwindCSS utility classes** to handle spacing, alignment, and color styling without writing custom CSS.
- I practiced designing layouts using **flexbox** and **grid** to ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes.
- I understood how to use **consistent color palettes** and typography for professional website design.
- I learned how to organize large HTML files with nested `<div>` elements clearly and logically.

---

##  Design Choices
- I used **pure white backgrounds** with **teal highlights (#A7DEE0, #98D1D1)** for a clean, calm medical aesthetic.
- The **Poppins font** gives a modern and professional look suitable for healthcare.
- Rounded buttons, consistent spacing, and minimal text maintain a sense of comfort and simplicity.
- Added subtle hover effects to enhance user interactivity without distracting from the design.

---

##  Technical Highlights
- Used **responsive design principles** via Tailwind’s `flex-col`, `md:flex-row`, and spacing utilities.
- Incorporated a **grid-based service layout** and a **side-by-side appointment form**.
- Learned how to align text and images proportionally for both mobile and desktop screens.
- Experimented with **shadow effects** and **rounded corners** for modern appeal.

---

##  Challenges Faced
- Managing multiple nested `<div>` tags was challenging at first, especially keeping the layout aligned.
- It took time to understand Tailwind’s responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:`) for mobile-first design.
- Aligning images and text evenly across all sections required adjusting padding and flex alignment carefully.

---

##  Future Improvements
- Add **form validation** and **email integration** for actual appointment submissions.
- Include **animations or scroll effects** for smoother transitions.
- Create a **separate navigation bar** that sticks to the top while scrolling.

##  Final Thoughts
This project helped me improve both my **HTML structuring** and **TailwindCSS styling** skills.  
It strengthened my understanding of responsive web design, alignment, and the importance of visual balance.  
Overall, it was an enjoyable and educational experience that enhanced my confidence in building complete web pages from scratch.
