# Reflection – Practical 4 (HTML Lists and Tables)

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 4 folder.  
For each exercise, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

## 1. College Events – HTML Lists
### What I Learned
- Learned to use both **ordered (`<ol>`)** and **unordered (`<ul>`)** lists effectively.  
- Understood how to **nest lists** to display event titles and details together.  
- Practiced adding structure and readability using **semantic HTML tags**.

### Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled to maintain proper indentation for nested lists.  
- The event details appeared misaligned when using multiple list levels.

### How I Overcame Them
- Used **CSS margin and padding** adjustments for proper alignment.  
- Rechecked the HTML structure to ensure every list tag was correctly opened and closed.

## 2. HTML Tables – Data Representation
### What I Learned
- Learned to create well-structured tables with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.  
- Understood the use of **table attributes** like `border` and `border-collapse`.  
- Practiced representing multiple data types — text, numbers, and totals — within one table.

### Challenges Faced
- Faced issues aligning table borders evenly.  
- Initially forgot to include `<tfoot>` for the total row in the fruit table.

### How I Overcame Them
- Added an internal `<style>` section to apply `border-collapse: collapse`.  
- Validated my HTML structure to ensure all tags were closed properly.

## 3. Semester Grades Tracker – Table Enhancement
### What I Learned
- Learned to design more **complex tables** with multiple columns.  
- Gained experience using tables to represent academic data with percentages and grades.  
- Practiced creating a clean, readable layout through consistent column spacing.

### Challenges Faced
- Maintaining equal column width and alignment for large tables was challenging.  
- The table appeared too cluttered when borders were not properly collapsed.

### How I Overcame Them
- Adjusted **column spacing and cell padding** to make the table more organized.  
- Applied consistent border styles to achieve a clean look.

## Overall Reflection
Practical 4 helped me strengthen my understanding of how to structure data visually using **HTML lists and tables**.  
These exercises showed me the importance of proper HTML hierarchy, semantic clarity, and consistent styling.  
By combining lists and tables, I learned to organize different types of information clearly and professionally.

### Future Improvements
- I want to explore **responsive table layouts** using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  
- I plan to enhance my tables with **colors and hover effects** for better user interaction.  
- I will continue practicing **semantic HTML** for improved accessibility and structure.
